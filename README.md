Explore the codebase of Evolve Code, a business specializing in website and systems development. This repository, crafted using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, represents the first version of our website. While the visual aesthetics may be outdated, this repository stands as a testament to our journey.

Please note that this repository represents the first version of our website. We're currently in the process of developing a new web application using React.js, and a separate repository will house the code for the upgraded version. This repository will be maintained for historical purposes.

Feel free to clone or fork this repository to examine the codebase and see our early work in website and systems development.
